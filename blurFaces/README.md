# AWS Lambda Video Stabilizer

This blurs the faces found in an image uploaded to an S3 bucket and moves it to
the corresponding bucket under the same key. Uses AWS Rekognition to find faces.

For the AWS Serverless Application Repo and AWS Machine Learning hackathon.

Install the dependencies on your own with:

`pip install -t <your code directory>  -f requirements.txt`
